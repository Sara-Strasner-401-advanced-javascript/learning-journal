# Computer Architecture and Logic

## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
There are 4 things common to all computers:
1. Input
1. Storage
1. Processing
1. Output

## How Computers Work: Binary and Data
Electric wires and circuits carry all the information in a computer. A binary number sysyem only has two digits, 0 and 1, which are represented by electrical signals being on or off. Binary code can represent numbers, text, images, etc. 

Binary code is the backbone of how computers input, store, process, and output information. 

## How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic
Circuits modify and process information that is stored in ones and zeroes, a.k.a. binary code. 

## How Computers Work: Memory, CPU, Input and Output
Information is input from the physical world and stored in memory. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is where all the calculations are done. Output devices take the information and convert it to a phyiscal output. 

## How Computers Work: Hardware and Software
Hardware includes all the circuits, chips, plugs, wires, speakers, and other physical components of a computer. Software is all the computer programs or code running on the machine. The CPU is the master chip that controls all other parts of the computer, utilizing the appropriate circuits to complete functions. The operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
