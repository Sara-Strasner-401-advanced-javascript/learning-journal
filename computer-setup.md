# Computer Setup


## Code Editors/Tools
While there is no one "best" code editor, there are a few features to look for when choosing a text editor (adapted from [Choosing a Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)):
 - code completion
 - syntax highlighting
 - a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
 - the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

Another option is an **IDE (Integrated Development Environment),** which is a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. 

## Command Line
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

### Command Line Prompts
- 'pwd' stands for Print Working Directory. It tells you what your current or present working directory is
 - 'ls' is short for list and shows the files that are in your current location
 - 'cd'  stands for change directory

### Paths
Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a **path.** A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

- *Relative path* is a file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
- *Absolute path* is a file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
