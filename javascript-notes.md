# JavaScript Notes

A script is a set of instructions that a computer can follow step by step. East individual step is known as a **statement.** Statements should end with a semicolon.

> Keep in mind that JavaScript is case sensitive.

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. The data stored in a variable can change, or vary, each time a script runs.
