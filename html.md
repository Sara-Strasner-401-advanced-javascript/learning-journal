# Structuring Web Pages with HTML

## Process and Design
- Be sure you have a clear understanding of who your audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they are looking for, and when they are likely to return to your site.
- Utilize **site maps** to plan the structure of your website. 
- **Wireframes** let you organize the information that will go on each page of your site. 
- **Visual Hierarchy** allows your audience to understand what you are trying to tell them. 
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
- Use groupings and similarity to help simplify the information you present. 

## Structuring Web Pages with HTML
- HTML uses **tags** (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning. 
    - Tags are often referred to as elements.
    - Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
    - Opening tags can carry **attributes**, which tell us more about the content of that element.
        - Attributes require a name and a value. 

## HTML5
- The new HTML5 elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple `<div>` elements)
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. In this case, extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
