# learning-journal
This is my learning journal for 102!

Maintaining a growth mindset will be critical for my success in this course. A growth mindset means focusing on your growth and capacity to learn and improve, and not on what you don't already know. 

Keep in mind
- Everyone is a beginner at some point.
- Don't compare yourself to other people.
- Prepare to fail. That is how you learn.
