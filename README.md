# Learning Journal
## This is my learning journal for 102!

Maintaining a **growth mindset** will be critical for my success in this course. A growth mindset means focusing on your own improvement and capacity to learn and improve, and not on what you don't already know. 

I'll keep in mind:
- Everyone is a beginner at some point.
- Don't compare yourself to other people.
- Prepare to fail. That is how you learn. 

### Always maintain a growth mindset. You can do it!
